Introduction
============

The VFX-rs project is dedicated to the following mission:

- Create C wrappers for libraries used in the VFX industry
- Create Rust wrappers for libraries used in the VFX industry
- Give ownership of the code and crates to the wrapped projects, or the ASWF.

We are on the `#rust` channel in academysoftwarefdn.slack.com (invites are https://slack.aswf.io/).

This is an unofficial ASWF project. However, since this community makes use of ASWF resources, unless otherwise stated, we follow any and all policies that the ASWF sets out. This means that while we are not associated to the foundation, we hold ourselves to the standards of the foundation.
