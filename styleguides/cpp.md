For the most part, this project should not be writing much C++ code. But when we do, take the following in account:

- The projects we are wrapping usually have a style guide. Follow that, or make a best guess based on the code already written.
- Usually the projects use clang-format. It's highly recommended to also use clang-format, and run it whenever the file is saved.
